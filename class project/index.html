            <h4>Mathematics Club</h4>
            <p>Activities include math games, puzzles, discussions of mathematics related problems, etc. Club members form the core of the Math Jeopardy Team! The team usually attends the Southeastern Section of the MAA (Mathematical Association of America) conference and competition.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Computer Club</h4>
            <p>Activities include analyzing/studying codes, developing programming projects, etc. Club members are usually the core members of the team competing in the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Southeast USA Regional Intercollegiate Programming Contest. Our computer club
                 is also a student chapter of ACM at AUM.</p>
            <hr>
            <h4>Engineering ClLub</h4>
            <p>Activities include robotics, radio control plane, etc. Some members are also  members of the Math or Computer clubs. The club has an engineering lab. Students use the lab to perform experiments. The lab also houses a Biodiesel system. The system can convert waste cooking
                 oil to biodiesel fuel. There is an annual engineering competition open to students registered in the “Introduction to Engineering” class.  WindTurbine, electric motor bike, robotic arms, etc. are some past competition projects.</p>
